# MENA-Water-Resource-Allocation-ML-approach

• Using data from different sources, my team and I created a predictor that takes in features such as water and agriculture resources and demographics such as a state’s population to predict a county’s water needs, specifically for countries in the MENA (Middle East, North Africa) region.

• Trained multiple models including SVM, OLS Regressor, Regression Trees, and Cross-validation methods.
